 *    a `blob:` object URL. `revoke: true` — the caller must
 *    `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` once it is no longer displayed.
 *  - SFTPGo storage: the entity-service refuses to serve attachment bytes
 *    directly for this data source, so a short-lived public share URL is
 *    minted instead (`POST /attachments/{id}/share`) and used as-is.
 *    `revoke: false` — this is not a `blob:` URL and must not be revoked.

 * `application/octet-stream` by the backend as a deliberate stored-XSS
