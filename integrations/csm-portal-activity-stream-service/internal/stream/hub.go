// Package stream is the in-process pub-sub side of case-activity SSE: a
// BroadcastHub that fans a per-case string payload out to every open
// /cases/{id}/activities/stream connection on this replica. It carries no
// auth or transport concerns of its own — the HTTP handler that registers
// with it (internal/handler.StreamCaseActivities) sits behind the same
// middleware.Auth chain as every other endpoint.

// a slow reader — a client that isn't draining its channel fast enough just
